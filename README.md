# honestcode.io (no longer maintained)

After almost 5 years offering a SaaS focused on Accetpance Test Driven-Development management, we have decided to shutdown.

ATDD still being one of the best programing practices in order to ensure quality software, however most developers applies ATDD in many different ways and HonestCode.io was designed to apply ATTD in a very rigid way. So, evolving the platform would be too effort comparing with the expected benefits.

We are cleaning a little bit the code, and we will publish all the [**source code**](https://github.com/honest-code) in order to at least share some useful pieces of code.
